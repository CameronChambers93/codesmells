# Code Smells Detection for JavaScript Applications

This project was worked on by myself and my co-author Charlie during the summer of 2017 for the <b>Oakland University Undergraduate Computer Research (UnCoRe)</b> in Cybersecurity. From the abstract of our paper:

<i>Code  smells  are  poor  design  choices  that,  while
not  necessarily  bugs,  can  negatively  impact  the  quality  of  an
application.  Some  affect  the  maintainability  of  the  code,  while
others  can  break  programs.  Our  task  is  to  learn  about  the
code smells that are applicable to JavaScript applications. From
there we will use Type Analyzer for JavaScript to build a flow
graph  modeling  JavaScript  programs  and  study  the  patterns
that these code smells generate. From these patterns we will be
able to modify the TAJS source code to detect the code smells.</i>

Over the course of 10 weeks we achieved the following:
- Researched code smells in general, and as they pertain to JavaScript applications
- Researched Type Analyzer for JavaScript (TAJS) and abstract syntax trees
- Found examples of code smells and studied patterns in the AST generated by the code smells
- Developed ways to detect instances of code smells
- Ran our program on handful of applications and recorded results

Most of the code we wrote is contained within <b>src/dk/brics/tajs/monitoring/Monitoring.java</b>. Most of the methods we implement are fired when specific AST nodes are generated or processed.
